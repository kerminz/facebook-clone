# Facebook Clone

Back in the days when I started coding seriously, I've built a Facebook clone with PHP, Javascript (Angular 1) and MySQL.
The entire front end is based on Twitters Bootstrap Theme. 

Additionaly I've integreated a websocket service from pusher.com for pushing messages in real time, when a new post has been created.
